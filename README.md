Hello, there! My name is Hansel. I grew up in a small island Southeast of the Philippines. I have always been fascinated by computer and technology since I was a kid but growing up in a small, technology-starved town, I didn't get the chance to explore this wonderful world of 1s and 0s until I moved here in the US.

I started Lambda School's Web Dev curriculum in January 2021 and since then, I have never felt more passionate about anything. I thrive on the required critical-thinking and problem-solving skills in this field. I love learning and I hope to find a place where people value passion to learn and grow as a web developer and as a person.
